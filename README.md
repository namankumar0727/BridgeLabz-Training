**(Date: 26-Dec-2025)**

- Learned the fundamentals of Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs) in Java.
- Implemented 10 programs (5 Level 1 + 5 Level 2) using real-world examples.
- Understood object creation and real-world problem modeling.

- Studied OOP concepts:
  - Classes and Objects
  - Constructors
  - Methods
  - Encapsulation
  - Memory allocation basics

- Level 1 Programs:
  - Employee Details Program
  - Area & Circumference of Circle
  - Book Details Management

## 🗓 Day 3 – Static, Final & Object Behavior  
**Date:** 29 December 2025

On the third day of training, the focus was on understanding important Java keywords and operators that control memory, immutability, and object behavior. Along with theory, multiple real-world practice programs and scenario-based problems were implemented to strengthen practical understanding.

---

### ✅ Activities Completed

#### 📘 Learned Core Java Keywords and Concepts
- **static keyword**  
  (class-level variables and methods)
- **final keyword**  
  (constants, method prevention, and immutability)
- **instanceof operator**  
  (runtime object type checking)

#### 🛠 Developed Practice Programs Using Real-World Entities
- BankAccount  
- Book  
- Library  
- Company  
- Patient  
- Product  
- Student  
- Vehicle  

#### 🧩 Applied Object-Oriented Principles
- Encapsulation  
- Class design  
- Method usage  

#### ✨ Coding Practices
- Practiced writing clean and structured Java programs  
- Followed proper naming conventions  

#### 🔄 Version Control
- Committed and pushed all completed programs to the remote repository  
- Used standard Git practices
