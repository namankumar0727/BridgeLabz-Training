---

## Day 1: Introduction to Design Principles
**Date:** 1 February 2026

## Topics Covered
- SOLID Principles
  - Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
  - Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
  - Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
  - Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
  - Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
- General Design Principles
  - Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)
  - Keep It Simple, Stupid (KISS)
  - You Aren't Gonna Need It (YAGNI)

## Overview
- Design principles provide guidelines for writing clean, maintainable, scalable, and extensible software
- They reduce tight coupling, improve readability, and simplify future enhancements

## Why Design Principles Matter
- Improve maintainability and scalability
- Reduce code duplication and complexity
- Encourage loose coupling and high cohesion
- Make systems easier to extend and test

## Day 2: Introduction to GoF Design Patterns & UML Designing
**Date:** 2 February 2026

## Topics Covered
- Introduction to GoF Design Patterns
  - What are Design Patterns
  - Gang of Four (GoF) Overview
  - Purpose and Benefits of Design Patterns
- Categories of GoF Design Patterns
  - Creational Patterns
  - Structural Patterns
  - Behavioral Patterns

## Design Patterns Studied
- Singleton Pattern
  - Ensures only one instance of a class exists
  - Provides a global point of access
- Factory Pattern
  - Creates objects without exposing instantiation logic
  - Promotes loose coupling
- Observer Pattern
  - Defines one-to-many dependency between objects
  - Notifies observers on state change
- Builder Pattern
  - Separates object construction from representation
  - Useful for creating complex objects step by step

## UML Designing
- Class diagrams for design pattern representation
- Identifying relationships
  - Association
  - Inheritance
  - Dependency
- Visualizing object interactions and responsibilities

## Why Use Design Patterns?
- Reusable and proven solutions
- Improves code flexibility and maintainability
- Encourages best practices in software design
- Makes systems easier to understand and extend

## Questions Practice
- Smart University Library Management System
- Library Management System (LMS) with GoF Patterns
