📅 Week 2: Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs)
🗓 Day 1 – Objects and Classes

(Date: 26-Dec-2025)

Learned the fundamentals of Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs) in Java.

Implemented 10 programs (5 Level 1 + 5 Level 2) using real-world examples.

Understood how objects and classes represent real-world entities.

Studied core OOP concepts:

Classes and Objects

Constructors

Methods

Encapsulation

Real-world problem modeling

Basics of memory allocation

Implemented Level 1 practice programs:

Employee Details Program

Area & Circumference of Circle

Book Details Management

Inventory Tracking System

Mobile Phone Details Program

Implemented Level 2 practice programs:

Student Report & Grade Calculator

ATM / Bank Account Simulation

Palindrome String Checker

Movie Ticket Booking System

🗓 Day 2 – Constructors, Access Modifiers & OOPs Practice

(Date: 27-Dec-2025)

Focused on constructors and access modifiers in Java.

Practiced applying OOPs concepts through hands-on programs.

Followed standard Java coding conventions and proper package structure.

Practiced constructor-related programs:

Book class with default and parameterized constructors

Circle class using constructor chaining

Person class using copy constructor

Hotel Booking System using multiple constructors

Library Book System with book borrowing functionality

Car Rental System with rental cost calculation

Practiced Instance vs Class variables and methods using:

Product Inventory Management System

Online Course Management System

Vehicle Registration System

Practiced access modifiers using:

University Management System

Book Library System with EBook subclass

Bank Account Management using SavingsAccount subclass

Employee Records with Manager subclass

Organized all programs into proper folders.

Committed and pushed all changes successfully.
